Today it's a pleasure to announce the applications of Mr. Unp3rf3ct are joining the Dynamotivation portfolio!

This merger has been a long time coming, as some of you may have noticed from the app mosaic on the homepage. Initially, there was no intention of bringing back the original applications. The scope was limited to offering more compatible alternatives.\
However, behind the scenes a number of things were worked out to make this possible, meaning that the original app listings will be able to receive updates once again.

During this transition, the source code and, eventually, the restored store listings will migrate under the Dynamotivation umbrella of apps.

This means that there will be no need to rebuild assets or recreate core functionality. Instead, all developmental efforts will focus on improving the user experience and expanding features to make the apps compatible with more devices than ever before!

Their original features will not be compromised by their eventual return. Thus it will take some time working my way through outdated codebases, recreating and porting features to newer frameworks.

That said, sadly not all apps can be brought back.

While it is sad to see them discontinued, all old versions we manage to get our hands onto will be preserved on The Internet Archive.

## Timeline

I currently cannot give a proper timeline for the transition, let alone rereleases and updates to take place. Time is needed to review and prepare before any actual work on the code can take place.

If you don't want to miss further annoucements, stay tuned by subscribing to the [RSS or Atom feeds](/news/general/rss-and-atom-feeds-now-available/) or by joining the Discord server.

Thanks to all previous users for your support. See you around for more Dynamotivation projects!
