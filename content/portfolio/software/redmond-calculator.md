***Redmond Calculator*** is a version of the Windows calculator built with Avalonia and .NET. It is one of the first two applications in the [Port Redmond](/portfolio/software/port-redmond/) project, together with [Redmond Notepad](/portfolio/software/redmond-notepad/). The calculation engine is the open-source code of Microsoft's Windows Calculator, included unmodified, and Redmond Calculator adds an interface modeled on the original.


## Features

---

The current version has:

*   Calculator modes
    *   Standard, scientific, programmer, graphing and date calculation.
*   Converters
    *   Volume, length, weight, temperature, energy, area, speed, time, power, data, pressure and angle, plus currency.
*   History and memory
    *   A history pane and a memory panel.
*   Currency rates
    *   Four sources to choose from: the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve H.10 tables, the Bank of Canada and Frankfurter. The app only contacts a source after you agree to it in Settings.
*   Appearance
    *   A light, dark or system theme and a choice of font. On macOS the window corners and window buttons can follow either Windows or macOS styles.


## Keyboard shortcuts

---

The shortcut list comes from the Windows Calculator's own definitions, including the mode switches and memory keys. On macOS, copy, paste and the graph zoom and reset shortcuts use <kbd>⌘</kbd> instead of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>. All other shortcuts keep their Windows keys. In Settings you can switch <kbd>⌘</kbd> back to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.


## Availability

---

No release has been published yet. The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Dynamotivation/port-redmond-calculator) under the MIT licence, and the README has build steps for macOS and Windows. It also runs on Linux.
