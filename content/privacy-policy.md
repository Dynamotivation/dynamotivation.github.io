{{ big_heading(name="Data Collection and Processing") }}

Our hosting providers collect the following data in log files, which your browser transmits when requesting the website:
- Your IP address
- The address of the website you visited before ours (referrer request header)
- The date and time of your visit
- The time difference to Greenwich Mean Time
- The content of your request
- The HTTP status code
- The amount of data transferred
- The website from which your request originates
- Information about your browser and operating system

This data collection is necessary to display the website and ensure its stability and security. This processing is based on the authors legitimate interest, in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

No tracking by the Data Controller occurs. The hosters do not make this data available to the Data Controller.

**The hosters may share this data with third parties if legally required (e.g., law enforcement authorities) or to serve their legitimate interests in accordance with their own privacy policies.**

The collected data is deleted as soon as it is no longer needed for its purpose.

{{ big_heading(name="International Data Transfers") }}

Therefore, the hosters are the recipients of your personally identifiable information. This arrangement reflects the author's legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR in not having to maintain their own server on their premises.\
GitHub's servers are located in the USA.\
Uploadcare's servers are located world wide, in and outside of the EU and EEA.

Processing the data listed above is needed for technical reasons and neither legally nor contractually required by the hosters. However, without this processing, they cannot server the website to you.

The hosters have implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These measures apply to all activities worldwide where the hosters process personal data of EU individuals. The measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). You can find more details here:\
